## Sparta Rails Blog Homework

##### Description: I made a simple application using ruby on rails that allows the user to create users on the app and then write blogs as one of the users selected. It also allows that user, and other users, to add comments to blogs. All areas of the site had to be fully linked together, and there is also a landing page and navbar.

**Technology Used - Atom, Ruby on Rails, Google Chrome **

## Challenges:

1. Using nested routes.

2. Figuring out exactly how to link every page together.

## Takeaways:

1. The process of linking each page together greatly increased my understanding of how to navigate between pages using links, e.g. exactly what information the browser requires (such as various ID's) in order for it to know where to take the user to, once they have clicked on a particular link.

6. Open the code in your chosen text editor, such as Atom.
7. Type in 'rake db:create' and 'rake db:seed' in your command line to create the database.
